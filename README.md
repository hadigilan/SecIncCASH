# Introduction
This project strive to provid a comprehensive references for the phenomenon documented by Bates et al. (2009). They document that the average cash-to-assets ratio for the US industrial firms more than doubled between 1980 to 2006. The figure below illustrates that this surge in cash has continued in recent years.
This phenomenon is known as ‘corporate savings glut’ in literature and popular press (Falato et al., 2020).

# The factors
To describe the observed trend in the time series of US firms' cash holdings, authors introduce different factors from different perspectives. 
In this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYnN-2_9oZmnNFHefQrnmEiUmphaRApzCQQVirDD7hM/edit?usp=sharing), we introduce these factors along with their relevant information including the rationale behind each factor.

 
# Relative importance

Although describing the surge in cash has been the subject of many studies, a major gap remains in the literature regarding the relative importance of the potential drivers.
